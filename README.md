# Fruit-Classifier

A sequential convolutional neural network model for image classification on the Fruits-360 dataset.  
The dataset contains a collection of 90483 high-quality images of 131 types of fruits and vegetables, including apples, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, and peppers, among others. The images are saved in JPG format and have a resolution of 100 x 100 pixels, which makes the dataset relatively easy to work with.
The model consists of 4 convolutional layers, followed by a flattening layer, 2 fully connected layers, and an output layer. The model has a total of approximately 3.3 million parameters.  
The model was trained for 10 epochs on GPU-P100 and gave an accuracy of 97.2%
